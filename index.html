<h1 id="overview"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Overview</h1>
<p>The purpose of this assignment is introduction to programming in shared and distributed memory models and on GPUs. Your goal is to parallelize a toy particle simulator (similar particle simulators are used in <a href="http://www.thp.uni-duisburg.de/~kai/index_1.html">mechanics</a>, <a href="http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/">biology</a>, <a href="https://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/gadget/clusters/index.html">astronomy</a>, etc.) that reproduces the behavior shown in the following animation:</p>
<figure>
<img src="media/animation.gif" alt="Animation" /><figcaption>Animation</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The range of interaction forces is limited as shown in grey for a selected particle. Density is set sufficiently low so that given n particles, only O(n) interactions are expected. Suppose we have a code that runs in time T = O(n) on a single processor. Then we’d hope to run in time T/p when using p processors. We’d like you to write parallel codes that approach these expectations. Don’t forget to use the no output <code>-no</code> option for your actual timing runs you use in these calculations and plots.</p>
<h1 id="remote-xsedemoodle-students-please-read"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Remote XSEDE/Moodle Students: Please Read</h1>
<p>Dear Remote Students, we are thrilled to be a part of your parallel computing learning experience and to share these resources with you! To avoid confusion, please note that the assignment instructions, deadlines, and other assignment details posted here were designed for the local UC Berkeley students. You should check with your local instruction team about submission, deadlines, job-running details, etc. and utilize Moodle for questions. With that in mind, the problem statement, source code, and references should still help you get started (just beware of institution-specific instructions). Best of luck and we hope you enjoy the assignment!</p>
<h1 id="correctness-and-performance"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Correctness and Performance</h1>
<p><strong>A simple correctness check which computes the minimal distance between 2 particles during the entire simulation is provided. A correct simulation will have particles stay at greater than 0.4 (of cutoff) with typical values between 0.7-0.8. A simulation were particles don’t interact correctly will be less than 0.4 (of cutoff) with typical values between 0.01-0.05 . More details as well as an average distance are described in the source file.</strong></p>
<p>The code we are providing will do this distance check based on the calls to the interaction function but the full autograder will do the checks based on the outputted txt file. We’d recommend keeping the correctness checker in your code (for the OpenMP and MPI codes the overhead isn’t significant) but depending on performance desires it can be deleted as long as the simulation can still output a correct <code>.txt</code> file.</p>
<p>The performance of the code is determined by doing multiple runs of the simulation with increasing particle numbers and comparing the performance with the <code>autograder.cpp</code> provided. This can be done automatically with the <code>auto-*</code> scripts. However, make sure your code is fully tested before running the autograders at full scale (repeatedly running the autograders unmodified for testing can eat up your compute hours allocation quickly).</p>
<p>There will be two types of scaling that are tested for your parallel codes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In strong scaling we keep the problem size constant but increase the number of processors</p></li>
<li><p>In weak scaling we increase the problem size proportionally to the number of processors so the work/processor stays the same (Note that for the purposes of this assignment we will assume a linear scaling between work and processors)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For more details on the options provided by each file you can use the <code>-h</code> flag on the compiled executables.</p>
<p><strong>Important note for Performance:</strong></p>
<p><strong>While the scripts we are providing have small numbers of particles (500-1000) to allow for the O(n^2) algorithm to finish execution, the final codes should be tested with values 100 times larger (50000-100000) to better see their performance.</strong></p>
<h1 id="teams"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Teams</h1>
<p><strong>You may work in groups of 2 or 3 (no more, no fewer). One person in your group should be a non-EECS student, but otherwise you are responsible for finding a group. The number of non-EECS students is a little less than half the total enrollment, so some teams may not have a non-EECS student. In that case, one person in such team should be a non-CS student. Once you have a group, add yourselves to a bCourses group (we have pre-created empty groups) by following <a href="https://guides.instructure.com/m/4212/l/64913-how-do-i-join-a-group-as-a-student">these instructions</a>. Also, we recommend you come to GSI office hours with your group to discuss the distribution of work among team members.</strong></p>
<h1 id="source-code"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Source Code</h1>
<p>You may start with the serial and parallel implementations supplied below. All of them run in O(n^2) time, which is unacceptably inefficient.

<p>For Part 2, in a zip file (see below), submit the files from Part 1, your MPI code for Part 2, and extend your original report to include Part 2. Your MPI code should run in O(n) time with, hopefully, O(n/p) scaling. You are welcome to improve your code from Part 1 though not required; if you do, include a description of your improvements (and why they work) in your report as well.</p>
<p>Your submission should be a single <code>teamname_hw2.tar.gz</code> that, when unzips, gives us a folder named <code>teamname_hw2</code>. In this folder there should be one subfolder named <code>part1</code>, a report file named <code>report.pdf</code>, and a text file named <code>members.txt</code> containing your teammate’s names, one line for each member. We need to be able to build and execute your implementations for you to receive credit. Spell out in your report what <code>Makefile</code> targets we are to build for the different parts of your report.</p>
<p>For example, <code>03_hw2.tar.gz</code> should have:</p>
<pre><code>03_hw2 (a folder)
  |--part1 (a folder)
  |----source files for serial, openmp, mpi

<p>We have provided a naive O(n^2) GPU implementation, similar to the openmp, and MPI codes listed above. It will be your task to make the necessary algorithmic changes and machine optimizations to achieve favorable performance across a range of problem sizes.</p>
<h2 id="help"><span class="header-section-number">8.3</span> Help</h2>
<p>A simple correctness check which computes the minimal distance between 2 particles during the entire simulation is provided. A correct simulation will have particles stay at greater than 0.4 (of cutoff) with typical values between 0.7-0.8. A simulation were particles don’t interact correctly will be less than 0.4 (of cutoff) with typical values between 0.01-0.05 .</p>
<p>Adding the checks inside the GPU code provides too much of an overhead so an autocorrect executable is provided that checks the output txt file for the values mentioned above. We also provide a clean serial implementation that can run on a gpu for you to start from, serial.cu.</p>
<h2 id="submission-1"><span class="header-section-number">8.4</span> Submission</h2>
<p>Similarly to Part 2, submit your files in a single <code>teamname_hw2.tar.gz</code> in the following format:</p>

<h1 id="resources"><span class="header-section-number">9</span> Resources</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Programming in shared and distributed memory models have been introduced in Lectures 4 through 7, which are available at <a href="https://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~demmel/cs267_Spr16/">the course website</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Shared memory implementations may require using locks that are availabale as <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/7d2zxc0s(VS.80).aspx"><code>omp_lock_t</code></a> in OpenMP (requires <code>omp.h</code>) and <a href="https://opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/pthread_mutex_lock.html"><code>pthread_mutex_t</code></a> in pthreads (requires <code>pthread.h</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>You may consider using atomic operations such as <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.1.2/gcc/Atomic-Builtins.html#Atomic-Builtins"><code>__sync_lock_test_and_set</code></a> with the GNU compiler. This syntax changes between compilers.</p></li>
<li><p>Distributed memory implementation may benefit from overlapping communication and computation that is provided by <a href="http://www.mpi-forum.org/docs/mpi-1.1/mpi-11-html/node46.html">nonblocking MPI routines</a> such as <code>MPI_Isend</code> and <code>MPI_Irecv</code>.</p></li>

<li><p>It can be very useful to use a performance measuring tool in this homework. Parallel profiling is a complicated business but there are a couple of tools that can help.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.nersc.gov/users/software/debugging-and-profiling/ipm/">IPM</a> is a profiling tool that is inserted into your link command in your <code>Makefile</code> (after you module load <code>ipm</code>) and instrumented versions of your MPI calls are put into your program for you.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.cs.uoregon.edu/Research/tau/home.php">TAU (Tuning and Analysis Utilities)</a> is a source code instrumentation system to gather profiling information. You need module load tau to access these capabilities. This system can profile MPI, OpenMP and PThread code, and mixtures, but it has a learning curve.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://hpctoolkit.org/">HPCToolkit</a> Is a sampling profiler for parallel programs. You need <code>module load hpctoolkit</code>. You can install the <code>hpcviewer</code> on your own computer for offline analysis, or use the one on NERSC by using the <a href="https://www.nersc.gov/users/network-connections/nersc-nx-service-x-windows-acceleration-at-nersc/">NX client</a> to get X windows displayed back to your own machine.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are using TAU or HPCToolkit you should run in your <code>$SCRATCH</code> directory which has faster disk access to the compute nodes (profilers can generate big profile files).</p></li>
